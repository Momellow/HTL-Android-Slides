# Using Android Studio

On these slides we will discuss the usage of Android Studio.

## Starting a new Android Project
After starting Android Studio a welcomescreen is shown to the user. On this screen you can reopen former projects on the left side or start a new project on the right side.

If you have already created a project on another PC and you want to open it in school, please use `import project`.  
If you create a new project you want to use the wizzard to create the project stub.
